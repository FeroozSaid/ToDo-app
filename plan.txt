My plan with this is to make a To-do-task type of website.
I would like the landing page to give u the options between viewing tasks or creating one with a welcome to the page
When creating a task there must be some sort of name, description and setting a due date most likely using input type: date
when viewing tasks I think it would be convenient to display the tasks in order based on due date
and in terms of editing and deleting i think a simple edit and delete button on the task view page should be sufficent
